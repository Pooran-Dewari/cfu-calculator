# CFU Calculator
This [tool](https://pooran-dewari.github.io/cfu-calculator/) is designed (using chatgpt) to calculate colony-forming units per milliliter (cfu/mL) and to determine the volume of bacterial culture required to achieve a target CFU, such as for a bacterial bath challenge.

- To calculate cfu/mL at an optical density (OD) of 1.0, input the
  -   OD of the original culture used for the CFU assay, and
  -  the volume of culture spread onto the plate for colony counting (in ÂµL).
- To calculate the volume of bacterial culture required to reach a specific CFU, provide the OD600 of the bacterial culture (based on assumption bath challenge volume is 4L and target cfu/mL is 1.0E+06).
